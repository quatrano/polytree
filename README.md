**Polytree** is a paradigm for building web applications. As a whole it contains few patterns, which makes it easy to learn.  The core pattern is one that people are familiar with - a directed graph.  Central to the paradigm is a templating language inspired by [D3](http://d3js.org/).   The templating language gives developers the ability to describe the styles on DOM nodes using variables that are evaluated at runtime, along with the transitions to use when those variables change.
